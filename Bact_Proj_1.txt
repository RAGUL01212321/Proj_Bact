### **Circuit Blocks**

#### **1. Logistic Growth Simulation**
##### (A) Generating “1 - x/K”
1. Use a **voltage divider** to scale x:
   - Input voltage = \( x \) (simulated bacterial growth voltage)
   - Resistors: \( R_1 \) = 10 kΩ, \( R_2 \) = 10 kΩ
   - Output Voltage = \( x / 2 \) (i.e., “x / K” where \( K = 2 \)).

2. Use a **summing amplifier** to compute \( 1 - x/K ":
   - Use an op-amp in inverting mode.
   - Inputs:
     - \( V_{in1} = +1 V \) (reference voltage for 1)
     - \( V_{in2} = x / 2 \).
   - Output = \( - (1 - x/K) \). Use an inverting amplifier to correct polarity.

##### (B) Multiplication of x and (1 - x/K)
Since you don’t have an analog multiplier, we approximate multiplication:
1. Use a **resistor network** to manually approximate multiplication.
   - Choose resistor values based on expected voltage ranges.

##### (C) Integrator to Solve Logistic Equation
1. Use an op-amp integrator circuit:
   - Input = \( r x (1 - x/K) \).
   - Capacitor = 1 μF, Resistor = 10 kΩ (adjust for appropriate scaling).
   - Output simulates bacterial growth \( x \).

#### **2. Drug Effect Simulation (Penicillin)**
1. Use **Arduino Uno** to generate a step input or sinusoidal signal:
   - Step signal: Use `analogWrite` with a fixed output.
   - Sinusoidal signal: Use a DAC module (e.g., MCP4725).

2. Feed this signal into a **summing amplifier** to combine with bacterial growth.
   - Input 1: Output of logistic growth simulation.
   - Input 2: Arduino signal (simulating drug effect).
   - Output = Growth + Drug Effect.

### **Building the Circuits**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

**Step 1: Set Up the Breadboard**
- Place the LM741 op-amps on the breadboard.
- Connect the power supply (±12 V) to the op-amps: 
  - Pin 7 to +12 V, Pin 4 to -12 V.
  - Connect all grounds to a common rail on the breadboard.

**Step 2: Build the Voltage Divider**
- Connect two resistors (10 kΩ each) in series between the input voltage (“Growth Voltage”) and ground.
- Take the output from the middle point of the two resistors to get \( x / K \).

**Step 3: Build the Summing Amplifier**
- Use an LM741 op-amp for the summing amplifier:
  - Connect \( R_1 \) (10 kΩ) to the first input (“+1 V Reference”).
  - Connect \( R_2 \) (10 kΩ) to the second input (\( x / K \)).
  - Connect the output to another inverting amplifier (optional) to correct polarity.

**Step 4: Build the Integrator Circuit**
- Use another LM741 op-amp for the integrator:
  - Connect a capacitor (1 μF) between the output and the inverting input.
  - Connect a resistor (10 kΩ) between the inverting input and the input signal (\( r x (1 - x/K) \)).

**Step 5: Simulate Drug Effect with Arduino**
- Program the Arduino to generate a step or sinusoidal signal using `analogWrite` or a DAC module.
- Feed the Arduino output into a summing amplifier:
  - Combine the drug effect signal with the bacterial growth signal.

**Step 6: Monitor Outputs**
- Use ADALM2000 or a multimeter to monitor the output voltages at each stage.
- Check intermediate signals (e.g., \( x/K \), \( 1 - x/K \), and \( x (1 - x/K) \)) for correctness.
